No predicate has been defined yet
--------------------
--------------------
### Action Parameters
```
- ?p - package: the package to load
- ?t - truck: the truck to load the package into
- ?l - location: the location where the truck is currently situated
```

### Action Preconditions
```
(and
    (at ?t ?l) ; the truck is at the location
    (package-at ?p ?l) ; the package is at the same location
    (not (truck-full ?t)) ; the truck is not full
)
```

### Action Effects
```
(and
    (not (package-at ?p ?l)) ; the package is no longer at the location
    (truck-has-package ?t ?p) ; the truck now has the package
)
```

### New Predicates
```
- (at ?t - truck ?l - location): true if the truck ?t is at location ?l
- (package-at ?p - package ?l - location): true if the package ?p is at location ?l
- (truck-full ?t - truck): true if the truck ?t is full and cannot carry more packages
- (truck-has-package ?t - truck ?p - package): true if the truck ?t has the package ?p loaded
```


####################
Action: unload_truck
####################
--------------------
You can create and define new predicates, but you may also reuse the following predicates:- (at ?t - truck ?l - location)
- (package-at ?p - package ?l - location)
- (truck-full ?t - truck)
- (truck-has-package ?t - truck ?p - package)
--------------------
--------------------
### Action Parameters
```
- ?p - package: the package to unload
- ?t - truck: the truck from which to unload the package
- ?l - location: the location where the package will be unloaded
```

### Action Preconditions
```
(and
    (at ?t ?l) ; The truck is at the location
    (truck-has-package ?t ?p) ; The truck has the package
)
```

### Action Effects
```
(and
    (not (truck-has-package ?t ?p)) ; The truck no longer has the package
    (package-at ?p ?l) ; The package is now at the location
)
```

####################
Action: load_airplane
####################
--------------------
You can create and define new predicates, but you may also reuse the following predicates:- (at ?t - truck ?l - location)
- (package-at ?p - package ?l - location)
- (truck-full ?t - truck)
- (truck-has-package ?t - truck ?p - package)
--------------------
--------------------
### Response
The error message indicates that there is a type mismatch in the parameters of the action. Specifically, the predicate `(at ?a ?l)` is using `?a` as a plane, but the predicate `(at ?t - truck ?l - location)` requires `?t` to be of type `truck`. To resolve this, I will change the parameter `?a` to `?t` and ensure that the action reflects the correct types. 

Here is the corrected action definition:

### Action Parameters
```
- ?p - package: the package to load into the truck
- ?t - truck: the truck to load the package into
- ?l - location: the location where the loading occurs
```

### Action Preconditions
```
(and
    (package-at ?p ?l) ; The package is at the specified location
    (at ?t ?l) ; The truck is at the specified location
    (not (truck-full ?t)) ; The truck is not full
)
```

### Action Effects
```
(and
    (not (package-at ?p ?l)) ; The package is no longer at the location
    (truck-has-package ?t ?p) ; The truck now has the package
)
```

### New Predicates
```
``` 

This correction ensures that the parameters and predicates are consistent with their defined types.

--------------------
You can create and define new predicates, but you may also reuse the following predicates:- (at ?t - truck ?l - location)

--------------------
--------------------
### Response
The error message indicates that there is a type mismatch in the parameters of the action. Specifically, the predicate `(at ?pl ?l)` incorrectly uses `?pl` as a plane, while it should be a truck. To resolve this, I will change the parameter `?pl` to `?t` to represent a truck instead of a plane. Hereâ€™s the corrected action:

### Action Parameters
```
- ?p - package: the package to unload
- ?t - truck: the truck from which to unload the package
- ?l - location: the location where the package will be unloaded
```

### Action Preconditions
```
(and
    (at ?t ?l) ; The truck is at the location
    (truck-has-package ?t ?p) ; The truck has the package
)
```

### Action Effects
```
(and
    (not (truck-has-package ?t ?p)) ; The truck no longer has the package
    (package-at ?p ?l) ; The package is now at the location
)

Action: drive_truck
####################
--------------------
You can create and define new predicates, but you may also reuse the following predicates:- (at ?t - truck ?l - location)
- (package-at ?p - package ?l - location)
- (truck-full ?t - truck)
- (truck-has-package ?t - truck ?p - package)
--------------------

### Action Parameters
```
- ?t - truck: the truck to drive
- ?l1 - location: the starting location
- ?l2 - location: the destination location
- ?c - city: the city where the locations are
```

### Action Preconditions
```
(and
    (at ?t ?l1) ; The truck is at the starting location
    (connected ?l1 ?l2) ; The starting location is connected to the destination location
    (in-city ?l1 ?c) ; The starting location is in the specified city
    (in-city ?l2 ?c) ; The destination location is in the specified city

### Action Effects
```
(and
    (not (at ?t ?l1)) ; The truck is no longer at the starting location
    (at ?t ?l2) ; The truck is now at the destination location
)
```

### New Predicates
```
- (connected ?l1 - location ?l2 - location): true if location ?l1 is directly connected to location ?l2
- (in-city ?l - location ?c - city): true if location ?l is in city ?c

Action: fly_airplane
####################
--------------------
You can create and define new predicates, but you may also reuse the following predicates:- (at ?t - truck ?l - location)
- (package-at ?p - package ?l - location)
- (truck-full ?t - truck)
- (truck-has-package ?t - truck ?p - package)
- (connected ?l1 - location ?l2 - location)
- (in-city ?l - location ?c - city)
--------------------
--------------------
### Response
The error message indicates that the variable `?c1` was not found in the scope for the predicate `(in-city ?l1 ?c1)`. The available variables in scope are `?t`, `?l1`, and `?l2`. To resolve this issue, I will remove the reference to `?c1` and instead use a new variable `?c` to represent the city associated with the departure airport `?l1`. This will ensure that all variables used in the predicates are defined in the parameters section.

## Action

```
- ?t - truck: the truck to fly
- ?l1 - location: the departure airport location
- ?l2 - location: the arrival airport location

```

### Action Preconditions
