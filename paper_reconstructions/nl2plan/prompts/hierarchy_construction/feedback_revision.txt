======================================

End your final answers starting with "### TYPES" with the Python list of nested dictionaries in the format [{...}, {...}], where each dictionary represents a type with an optional "children" key containing subtypes. The content must be enclosed with ``` ``` comment blocks in PDDL as so:

### TYPES
```
[
    {
        "parent_type_1": "description for parent type 1",
        "children": [
            {
                "child_type_1": "description for child type 1",
                "children": [
                    {"child_child_type_1": "description for child type 1", "children": []},
                    {"child_child_type_2": "description for child type 1", "children": []}
                ]
            }
        ]
    },
    {
        "parent_type_2": "description for parent type 2",
        "children": [
            {
                "child_type_2": "description for child type 2",
                "children": [
                    {"child_child_type_3": "description for child type 2", "children": []}
                ]
            }
        ]
    }
]
```

If there are no children, leave the list empty.
