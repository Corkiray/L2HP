You now are revising your answer using feedback. Here is the feedback you outputted:

{fb_msg}

======================================

End your final answer starting with headers (in order) "### OBJECTS", "### INITIAL" and "### GOAL" containing respective content within the ``` ``` comment blocks in PDDL as so:
Do not declare these headers anymore else other than the final answer. 

### OBJECTS
```
object1 - type_1 ; comment for object1
object2 - type_2 ; comment for object2
object3 - type_1 ; comment for object3
```

Each object must be declared separately with their type and not grouped - even if objects share the same type.

### INITIAL
```
(<predicate_name> <object1> <object2>) ; comment for initial state predicate
(<predicate_name> <object3> <object4>) ; comment for initial state predicate
(<predicate_name> <object5>) ; comment for initial state predicate
(= (<function_name> <object6>) <value>) ; comment for a numeric assignment
```

### GOAL
```
(<predicate_name> <object>) ; comment for goal state predicate
(<operator> (<function_name> <object>) <value>) ; comment for a numeric assignment
```

======================================

Here are the information to work with:

## Problem
{problem_desc}

## Available Types
{types}

## Predicates
The following are the available predicates which can be used:
{predicates}

======================================

Apply the suggestions to your original answer:

### OBJECTS
```
{objects}
```

### INITIAL
```
{initial_states}
```

### GOAL
```
{goal_states}
