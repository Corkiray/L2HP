End your final answer starting with "### OBJECTS" containing the object types within the ``` ``` comment blocks in PDDL as so:

### OBJECTS
```
object1 - type_1
object2 - type_2
object3 - type_1
```

Each object must be declared separately with their type and not grouped - even if objects share the same type.
