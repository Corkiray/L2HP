End your final answer starting with headers (in order) "### OBJECTS" (with no brackets) "### INITIAL" and "### GOAL" containing respective content within the ``` ``` comment blocks in PDDL as so:

### OBJECTS
```
object1 - type_1 ; comment for object1
object2 - type_2 ; comment for object2
object3 - type_1 ; comment for object3
```

Each object must be declared separately with their type and not grouped - even if objects share the same type.

### INITIAL
```
(<predicate_name> <object1> <object2>) ; comment for initial state predicate
(<predicate_name> <object3> <object4>) ; comment for initial state predicate
(<predicate_name> <object5>) ; comment for initial state predicate
(= (<function_name> <object6>) <value>) ; comment for a numeric assignment
```

### GOAL
```
(<predicate_name> <object>) ; comment for goal state predicate
(<operator> (<function_name> <object>) <value>) ; comment for a numeric assignment
```
