List function variable types separately. Do not group them if they share the same types.

End your final answers starting with "### FUNCTIONS" with ``` ``` comment blocks in PDDL as so:

### FUNCTIONS
```
- (function_name_1 ?t1 - type_1 ?t2 - type_2): 'function_description'
- (function_name_2 ?t3 - type_3 ?t4 - type_4): 'function_description'
- (function_name_3 ?t5 - type_5): 'function_description'
```
