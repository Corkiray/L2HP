End your final answers starting with "### Action Effects" and "### New Predicates" with ``` ``` comment blocks in PDDL as so:

### Action Effects
```
(and
    (predicate_name ?t1 ?t2) ; COMMENT DESCRIPTION
)
```

### New Predicates
```
- (predicate_name ?t1 - type_1 ?t2 - type_2): 'predicate_description'
``` 

If there are no new predicates created, keep an empty space enclosed ```  ``` with the '### New Predicates' header.
